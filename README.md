# schema-mapper
A prototype system that transforms unstructured plain text into structured JSON outputs conforming to dynamic user-defined schemas. Supports high-context inputs (50k+ tokens) and large schemas (up to 100k tokens). Designed to be modular, easily extensible, and LLM-agnostic (works with GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
